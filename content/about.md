Hi! I'm Jonjo McKay, a software engineer from the South Coast of the UK.

I'm currently living in Exeter, Devon, and working as a Software Principal Engineer at Dell Boomi, where I am the lead for the **Boomi Flow** product (formerly ManyWho).

This is a place for me to share my thoughts and some interesting things I've learnt, but I'm no writer, so expect some rough edges! ðŸ˜…
